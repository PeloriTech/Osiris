# AI Servers

Serving AI at a production level is a non-negligible task.

Fortunately for us, we can do so with the help of open-source AI servers.

This folder provides scripts and instructions to setup the AI servers. In each folder the unique docker installation and bash scripts and details are listed out.

The osiris platform interacts with AI servers through a gateway architecture, allowing us to easily embed http endpoint based inference into our architecture.
